# Reserved tags API reference

This topic provides reference information about the `/reserved-tags` API endpoints.

## Overview

Use the `/reserved-tags` API endpoints to manage immutable tag keys for your organization so that project and workspace managers can follow a consistent tagging strategy.

| `DELETE` | `/reserved-tags/:reserved_tag_id` |  Deletes a reserved tag key with the specified ID. |
| `GET` | `/organizations/:organization_name/reserved-tag-keys` |  Lists reserved tag keys for the specified organization. |
| `POST` | `/organizations/:organization_name/reserved-tag-keys` |  Adds a reserved tag key. |
| `PUT` | `/reserved-tags/:reserved_tag_id` |  Updates the reserved tag key for the specified ID. |
